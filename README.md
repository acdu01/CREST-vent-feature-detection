# 1: Video Processing
Input videos will be processed and frames will be extracted and saved as .png files at 6 fps. 

## 1.1: Folder Structure

To process videos into PNG frames, organize your files as follows:

```
1_video_processing/
├── input_vid/ # Put your video files here
├── output_img/ # Output images will be saved here automatically
```

## 1.2: Usage

1. Place video files in the `1_video_processing/input_vid/` directory.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Extracted PNG frames will be saved into `1_video_processing/output_img/`.

You do **not** need to manually create the `output_img` folder — it will be generated by the script.

##  Supported Formats:

- **Input video formats**:
  - `.mp4`
  - `.mov`
  - `.avi`
  - `.mkv`
  - `.flv`
  - `.webm`

- **Output image format**:
