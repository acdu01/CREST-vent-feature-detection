
## 0: Setup


## 1: Video Processing
Input videos will be processed and frames will be extracted and saved as .png files at 6 fps. 

### 1.1: Folder Structure

The files are organized as follows:
```
1_video_processing/
├── input_vid/ # Put your video files here
├── output_img/ # Output images will be saved here automatically
```
You do **not** need to manually create the `output_img` folder — it will be generated by the script.

### 1.2: Usage

1. Place video files in the `1_video_processing/input_vid/` directory.
2. Run the following Python script:
```bash
python video2img.py
```
3. Extracted PNG frames will be saved into `1_video_processing/output_img/`.


###  Supported Formats:

- **Input video formats**:
  - `.mp4`
  - `.mov`
  - `.avi`
  - `.mkv`
  - `.flv`
  - `.webm`

- **Output image format**:
  - `.png`


## 2. Superpoint-Aided Keypoint Detection
This is an extension to [rpautrat](https://github.com/rpautrat/SuperPoint?tab=readme-ov-file)'s implementation of SuperPoint. It takes video files as input, extracts individual frames, and uses the SuperPoint network to detect and visualize keypoints on each frame.

For each processed video, the tool generates:

- Visualizations of the detected keypoints on each frame.
- Individual .csv files containing the XY coordinates for each keypoint.
- A summary .csv file detailing the processing results.

### 2.1: Folder Structure

The files are organized as follows:
```
2_sp_implementation/
├── input_vid/                      # Put your video files here
├── output/
│   ├── processing_summary.csv      
│   ├── csv/                        # Output .csv files with keypoint xy coordinates 
│   └── visualizations/             # Output images with keypoints highlighted
```
You do **not** need to manually create the `output` folder or any subfolders — it will be generated by the script.

### 2.2: Usage

1. Run the following Python script:
```bash
python detect_features.py
```
